# real_estate_agent.

this is an AI LLM powered real estate agent that is meant to match a database to the specifications mentioned by the customer through the openrouter API that powers the access to this language mode. This project has potential to be made into a agent that calls customers through a designated number to then get customers specifications to then match with the database.
